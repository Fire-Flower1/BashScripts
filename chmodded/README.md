# chmodded
A utility that aims to simplify chmod.

## Changing the log file
1. in your shell, type `nano /path/to/chmodded` (using another text editor is fine, but if you are new to linux I recommend nano
2. change the `CMLOGPATH` variable to the location you want the logs to be saved
**Be aware that you also have to add the name of the file you want to save it to at the end of your path.**

## WARNING
**THIS AUTOMATICALLY LOGS ALL USES IN A FILE NAMED CHMODDED.LOG IN A FOLDER NAMED CLOG, PLEASE MAKE THE FOLDER OR THE UTILITY MAY BREAK.**
