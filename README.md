# BashScripts
A set of linux bash scripts made in kali linux
I would recommend adding the file you keep these in to the PATH variable, since most of them are meant to be utilities for daily use.
For example I keep them in a file I named cbin, which stands for custom binaries.


### Chmodded Utility
This utility is meant to replace chmod with a (hopefully) smaller learning curve.
